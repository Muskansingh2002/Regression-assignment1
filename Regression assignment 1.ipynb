    "\n",
    "Linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. In other words, the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Check:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the observed vs. predicted values (residual plot). If the plot shows a random scatter around the horizontal axis (with no clear pattern), the linearity assumption is likely satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create scatter plots of each independent variable against the dependent variable to visually inspect linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence:\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations should be independent of each other. In time-series data, this means that there should be no correlation between consecutive residuals (no autocorrelation).\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Check:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Durbin-Watson test to detect autocorrelation in residuals. A value close to 2 indicates no autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-time-series data, ensuring that observations are randomly collected and not systematically related addresses independence."

    "\n",
    "Intercept (𝑏0=40): This means that if a car had zero weight (which is unrealistic, but this is what the model suggests), the fuel efficiency would be 40 MPG. While this doesn’t have much practical meaning, it serves as the starting value for the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope (𝑏1=−0.005): The slope tells us that for each additional pound in weight, the fuel efficiency decreases by 0.005 MPG. In other words, heavier cars have lower fuel efficiency.\n",
